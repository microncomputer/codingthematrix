2.13 Review Questions
• What is vector addition?
    add all corresponding elements of the vectors together and return a single vector, must be same sized vectors
• What is the geometric interpretation of vector addition?
    put the vectors head to tail in sequence. the result is the point at the end of the vectors
• What is scalar-vector multiplication?
    scalar is a single number. multiply this same number by each element in the vector to receive the scalar product
• What is the distributive property that involves scalar-vector multiplication but not vector
addition?
    (a+b)v = av+bv
• What is the distributive property that involves both scalar-vector multiplication and vector
addition?
    a(v+u) = av+au
• How is scalar-vector multiplication used to represent the line through the origin and a given
point?
    the line through the origin can be represented by all the "points" making up the line. each point is a
    scalar multiple of the same vector, the "given point"
    you can think of the line through the origin and a given point v as
    the set {alpha * v for all alpha in the reals}
• How are scalar-vector multiplication and vector addition used to represent the line through
a pair of given points?
    for points v1 and v2, the line through these points can be expressed as {alpha*(v2-v1) + (v1) for all alpha
    in the reals} or if it's the line segment between those two points, {alpha*(v2-v1)+v1 for all alpha in
    the reals where 0<=alpha<=1}

    you can also use a convex combination of the two points and say the line between two points is
    {alpha*v1 + beta*v2 for all alpha,beta in the reals s.t. alpha,beta >=0 and alpha+beta = 1}

• What is dot-product?
    sum of the products of each corresponding element in same size vectors
• What is the homogeneity property that relates dot-product to scalar-vector multiplication?
    alpha, a scalar and v,u vectors
    homogeneity property says that alpha(uTv) = (alpha*u)Tv  ((T is another way of saying dot(for dot product))
• What is the distributive property property that relates dot-product to vector addition?
    (u+v)Tw = uTw + vTw
• What is a linear equation (expressed using dot-product)?
    a linear equation is of the form aTx=beta, where a is a vector, beta is a scalar, and x is a vector variable
• What is a linear system?
    a series of linear equations that use the same variables
    xT(v1+v2+...+vn)=xTv1+xTv2+...+xTvn       (( T is for dot product)
• What is an upper-triangular linear system?
    they are easier to solve. each successive vector has one more leading zero element and one less
    variable element.
• How can one solve an upper-triangular linear system?
    get the system in order so the one with least unknowns is on the bottom and and highest unknowns is at the top.
    solve from bottom to top for each missing variable then plug that into the next equation. in theory, you will
    only ever be solving for one unknown at each step, making it easy as x+y=c
